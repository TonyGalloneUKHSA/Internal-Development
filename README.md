# Self-Development GitHub Environment

This repository is a personal sandbox for exploring and improving my skills in Git, Python, and Terraform. Each folder contains learning material, test files, and practical exercises that reflect my journey of technical growth and experimentation.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `/Git/`
A collection of Git experiments, test repositories, and configuration trials. This is where I:
- Practice branching, merging, and rebasing
- Test hooks and workflows
- Document useful commands and troubleshooting steps

### `/Python/`
A scratchpad for Python learning, including:
- Script prototypes
- Language feature experiments
- Practice problems and snippets

### `/Terraform/`
Infrastructure-as-code exercises focusing on:
- Learning core Terraform concepts
- Creating and destroying test environments
- Working with modules, providers, and state

## 🧪 Purpose

This repo is intentionally messy and experimental. It's **not for production**, but rather for:
- Rapid learning
- Making mistakes in a safe environment
- Tracking my technical progress

## 🗓️ Activity Log

- **May 21, 2025:**  
  - Created base folders for Git, Python, and Terraform  
  - Added placeholder `readme.md` files

## ✅ Notes

- Git is the primary focus — everything here is tracked, versioned, and treated as an opportunity to learn better workflows.
- I'm using this repo to simulate real-world practices (e.g., commit hygiene, branching strategies, documentation).
